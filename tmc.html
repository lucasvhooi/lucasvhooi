      <h2 class="title">ABOUT</h2>
      <p>During the COVID pandemic when we needed to stay inside I decided to challenge myself in creating my own streetwear brand. This idea has been stuck in my head for a while 
        and I decided that this was the perfect time to start this project. I named the brand The Monkey Co. (TMC.). I used the internet to start learing on everything needed 
        to start this kind of buisness. Starting by uploading some of my design on a Instagram and Facebook account. After a short while I started to get some traction on the Instgram account 
        and after a few weeks os building the brand I got a message from a company based in Rotterdam that was interested in partnering with me to produce my t-shirts and hoodies. I meeted them 
        a few times and after the first collection was fully finished I ordered. All clothes came from Italy with custome labels stitched in the neck. They also printed the design on the shirt 
        using the DTG printing method.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the time of production I created a webshop and started making adds for Instagram and Facebook. In about 2 months I reached 500 followers who were interested in the brand. 
        Eventualy when I launched the first collection I started getting 1 - 2 orders a week. With this being a small startup brand I was really happy with these results. I was afraid
        that beceause there are so many small streetwear brands these days that TMC. would just be another one of the brands that didnt get tracktion. Luckly this wasnt the case. In Photoshop
        I created eye catching Instagram post that got about 50 likes per post. I also did a photoshoot that really helped the brand look more professional.
         It took about 3 months before the hole collection was sold out.

        <h2 class="title" style="align-self: center;">DESIGNS</h2>
        <p>The Monkey Co. is my peronal take on a high quality colorfull streetwear brand. I really wanted the designs to pop. I think I made about 200 different designs for the first
          collection. Eventualy I picked the 5 designs I thought would work the best together. I wanted to attach a color to the brand so I made all the labels a bright purple also using this
          color in the packaging and social media posts. I created all the design in Photoshop and Illustrator using my own images and some copyright free images from the internet.
          As I love colors to pop I used a lot of saturated effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the right here there is one of the hoodie designs I made. Using a bright red and green there is a big contrast in the image. The backprint is a combination of images
          that I merged in Photoshop. Finally using a gradient filter to finish it. I wanted the image to tell a story but still being very vague as a dream often is.
          I combined this with the word DREAM. Using layer styles I created a metallic look to the font. I wanted to tie the front and back design together so on the front I wrote
          SEE YOU IN MY DREAM. I just really liked the quote and it fit in really well. to finish it of I added some sort of twirl behind the text. Supporting the dream aspect(like falling asleep or drifting away).

    <h2 class="title" style="color:white;">CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p style="color:white;">I learned a lot from this project. How to setup a webshop, creating products, managing a social media page and communicating with a supplyer are 
      some of the most important things I have learned. It also was a great way to practice my graphic design and photography. But the most important thing is that I really enjoyed
      doing it. There will always be setbacks but learning to coap with mistakes and come out stronger is a amazing way to strengthen your personal grow and design foundation.  
       I hope to continue with this project in the future and learn way more along the way!
