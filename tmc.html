        <h2 class="title">ABOUT</h2>
        <p>During the COVID pandemic when we needed to stay inside, I decided to challenge myself in creating my own
          streetwear brand. This idea has been stuck in my head for a while
          and I decided that this was the perfect time to start this project. I named the brand The Monkey Co. (TMC.). I
          used the internet to start learning on everything needed
          to start this kind of business. Starting by uploading some of my design on an Instagram and Facebook account.
          After a little while I started to get some traction on the Instagram account
          and after a few weeks of building the brand I got a message from a company based in Rotterdam that was
          interested in partnering with me to produce my t-shirts and hoodies. I meeted them
          a few times and after the first collection was fully finished I ordered. All clothes came from Italy with
          custom
          labels stitched in the neck. They also printed the design on the shirt
          using the DTG printing method.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          In the time of production I created a web shop and started making adds for Instagram and Facebook. In about 2
          months I reached 500 followers who were interested in the brand.
          Eventually when I launched the first collection, I started getting 2 - 3 orders a week. With this being a
          small
          startup brand I was really happy with these results. I was afraid
          that because there are so many small streetwear brands these days that TMC. would just be another one of the
          brands that didn't get traction. Luckly this wasn't the case. In Photoshop
          I created eye catching Instagram post that got about 50 likes per post. I also did a photoshoot that really
          helped the brand look more professional.
          It took about 3 months before the hole collection was sold out.

          <h2 class="title">DESIGNS</h2>
          <p >The Monkey Co. is my personal take on a high-quality colorful streetwear brand. I really wanted the designs
            to pop. I think I made about 200 different designs for the first
            collection. Eventually I picked the 5 designs I thought would work the best together. I wanted to attach a
            color to the brand so I made all the labels a bright purple also using this
            color in the packaging and social media posts. I created all the design in Photoshop and Illustrator using
            my
            own images and some copyright free images from the internet.
            As I love colors to pop, I used a lot of saturated effects.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            To the right here there is one of the hoodie designs I made. Using a bright red and green there is a big
            contrast in the image. The back print is a combination of images
            that I merged in Photoshop. Finally using a gradient filter to finish it. I wanted the image to tell a story
            but still being very vague as a dream often is.
            I combined this with the word DREAM. Using layer styles I created a metallic look to the font. I wanted to
            tie
            the front and back design together so on the front I wrote
            SEE YOU IN MY DREAM. I just really liked the quote and it fit in really well. to finish it off I added some
            sort of twirl behind the text. Supporting the dream aspect (like falling asleep or drifting away).

          <h2 class="title" style="color:white;">CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p style="color:white; padding-bottom: 20px;">I learned a lot from this project. How to setup a web shop, creating products,
            managing
            a social media page and communicating with a supplier are
            some of the most important things I have learned. It also was a great way to practice my graphic design and
            photography. But the most important thing is that I really enjoyed
            doing it. There will always be setbacks but learning to cope with mistakes and come out stronger is an
            amazing
            way to strengthen your personal grow and design foundation.
            I hope to continue with this project in the future and learn way more along the way!
