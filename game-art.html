            <p>Recently I started sketching environment. I dont draw often but I wanted to try and improve my drawing
              skills. Here are three of my recent drawings I made using Photoshop. At the moment I try and focus on
              building the compesition using simple shapes and using colors to create depth. At the moment I love
              drawing in a rought kind of way with bold strokes and focusing more on the full image then the small
              details.
              I use a small wacom drawing tablet for drawing. Environments is something that really interests me in game
              design so
              thats why I really wanted to practise this with drawing. And creating simple but storytelling artwork.</p>

            <p>To challenge myself I did what every 3D artist does and model a car :). For my project I used a
              Lamborghini. I used a blueprint from the internet and used Maya to make the model itself. I modelled the
              car using the front, side and back cameras. Here are some renders from the hard surface model.

          <div class="content">
            <p>Here are three models that I made using Substance Designer. I used small variations of the textures to
              blend
              them together in Unity to avoid repetition and create a more natural look. I really like the way you build
              up materials
              in substance designer and I wanted to improve my skills with creating own textures from the ground up. I
              wanted to create three
              diffrent kind of materials so I could use them in a unity project where I was experimenting with
              tesselation. I love using bright colors
              in my materials and I went for a more stylized look to create a kind of cartoony effect.

            <p>This is a 1:1 model of my own keyboard. Its a low poly game ready asset. I started with measuring my

              had finished the blockout I started adding all the details.</p>
            <p>For texturing I needed to unwrap the model. for texturing I used Substance Painter. I created a few
              diffrent materials that I used to texture the model. I made the final renders using the render in

          <h2>LEGENDS OF ESSOLIS</h2>
          <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Legends Of Essolis is a small game project I was working on after my internship. I wanted to get some C#
              experience by creating a small playable demo scene. I also wanted to try and expand my knowledge of shader
              building in Unity. My idea was to create a low poly stylized puzzle adventure game. With the focus on
              using
              the environment with the puzzles.
            </p>
            <p>
              All models and shaders are made by me with exception of the rocks. Using Unity ShaderGraph I created a
              water, vegetation and toon shader. With the toon shader I wanted to create a more stylized look to the
              game. Using C# I created a 3rd person character controller, a simple pickup system a waypoint system and a
              inventory system and a say night cycle. For the firefly's and fire I used particle systems. All models are
              made using Maya and textures are made using a colorgrid system in photoshop. I also used some optimisation
              tools like LOD meshes and occlusion culling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I perosnaly think that the level turned out great. A lot of people really liked the style of the level and
              really wanted to see more about the game. I learend a lot about optimisation and making shader in Unity.
              Overall
              it was a really positive experience!
